General comments
----------------------------------------

This was quite a wonderful project! An
extremely interesting idea, and generally
this was quite well-executed.

I appreciated the try...except error 
raising. Good effort in writing robust
code. Generally a reasonable amount
of commenting, but a little more documentation
would've been nice.

Although I suspect it made very little difference
to the final results, I wonder if the hack for
zero probabilities was necessary. A judicious
use of np.inf and some if statements would
probably have done the trick.

I very much liked that you did some test "books"
before putting in real books. Good software
writing practice.

While the posterior for "Great Expectations" was
indeed quite broad, I think "Beyond Light" was
actually quite narrow! You're plotting the log
probability, so given the numbers on your vertical
axis, the probabilities actually drop off quite
quickly. On the other hand, this does emphasize
the fact that some smoothing would probably be
a good idea.

It has been a real pleasure having you in my classes
these last two years! I hope you have a restful
and an enjoyable summer!

Best,
Adrian
